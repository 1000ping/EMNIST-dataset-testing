# EMNIST-dataset-testing
optimizer and model testing
I have tested different models and different types of emnist dataset for example .mat files and directly from images to improve 
testset performance and reduce testset accuracy and brought it down to 0.8808.I will try to work more on this dataset and test 
inceptionNet and ResNet on this dataset but for now my conclusion for this dataset is since it has so many ambiguity in the dataset
after 50 epoches it almost stops decreasing error. Ambiguity of the sort that capital M has so many small m in the dataset 
unable to differenciate between capital I 1(one) and small l and other similar looking features I trained the following model for 
70 epoches.
